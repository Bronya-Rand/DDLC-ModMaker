<h1>Quickstart<a class="headerlink" href="#quickstart" title="Permalink to this headline"> link</a></h1>
<p>Welcome to the Ren'Py quickstart manual. The purpose of this manual is
to demonstrate how you can make a Ren'Py game from scratch in a few
easy steps. We'll do this by showing how to make a simple game,
<em>The Question</em>.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-ren-py-launcher">
<h2>The Ren'Py Launcher<a class="headerlink" href="#the-ren-py-launcher" title="Permalink to this headline"> link</a></h2>
<p>Before you begin making a game, you should first take some time to
learn how the Ren'Py launcher works. The launcher lets you create,
manage, edit, and run Ren'Py projects.</p>
<p><strong>Getting Started.</strong> To get started you'll want to
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.renpy.org/latest.html">download Ren'Py</a>.</p>
<p>Once you've downloaded Ren'Py, you'll want to extract and run it.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>On Windows, double click on the executable file you download. It will
extract Ren'Py into a folder named <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">renpy-&lt;version&gt;</span></code>. You can change
into that folder and run <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">renpy.exe</span></code>. (The renpy.exe file may be presented
as renpy if extensions are hidden.)</li>
<li>On Mac OS X, double-click on the downloaded drive image to mount it as a
drive. When the drive opens, copy the folder named <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">renpy-&lt;version&gt;</span></code>
somewhere else. (Where does not matter, but it has to be moved out of
the read-only drive image. Do not move the renpy app out of the folder it's in
– it won't work elsewhere.) Then change into it, and run the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">renpy</span></code>
application.</li>
<li>On Linux, unpack the tarball, change into the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">renpy-&lt;version&gt;</span></code>
directory, and then run <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">renpy.sh</span></code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>After running this, the Ren'Py launcher should run.</p>
<p>The Ren'Py launcher has been translated to multiple languages. To
change the language, choose &quot;preferences&quot; at the bottom right, and then
select the language.</p>
<p><strong>Choosing and Launching a Project.</strong> You should first see what the
completed <em>The Question</em> game looks like. To do this, start the Ren'Py
launcher, and choose &quot;The Question&quot; from the first screen. Choose
&quot;Launch Project&quot; to start <em>The Question</em>.</p>
<p>You can get back to the Ren'Py demo by doing the same thing, but
choosing &quot;Tutorial&quot; instead of &quot;The Question&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Creating a new Project.</strong>
Create a new project by choosing &quot;Create New Project&quot; from the
launcher.</p>
<p>If this is your first time creating a project, Ren'Py may ask you to
select the projects directory. This is a directory (also called a folder)
where new projects are created, and is scanned for existing projects. The
directory chooser might pop up below Ren'Py, so be sure to look for it
there.</p>
<p>The launcher will then ask you for a project name. Since
&quot;The Question&quot; is already taken, you should enter something different,
like &quot;My Question&quot;, and type enter.</p>
<p>After that, the launcher will ask you to select the project resolution. The
default of 1280x720 is a good compromise between game size and image quality.
For the purpose of this tutorial, we will select 1280x720 to match
&quot;The Question&quot; game art, then click &quot;Continue&quot;.</p>
<p>The launcher will then ask you to choose a color scheme – an accent and
background color for the new GUI. It doesn't matter what you pick at
this point, so just pick something you find appealing, and then click
&quot;Continue&quot;.</p>
<p>At this point, Ren'Py will process for a bit, and spit out a simple game
template. The template used placeholder art and text, but is runnable, and
supports expected features like rollback, loading, and saving. Choose
&quot;Launch Project&quot; to run it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-simple-game">
<h2>A Simple Game<a class="headerlink" href="#a-simple-game" title="Permalink to this headline"> link</a></h2>
<div class="highlight-renpy"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">label</span> <span class="n">start</span><span class="p">:</span>

    <span class="s2">&quot;Sylvie&quot;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Hi there! How was class?&quot;</span>

    <span class="s2">&quot;Me&quot;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Good...&quot;</span>

    <span class="s2">&quot;I can&#39;t bring myself to admit that it all went in one ear and out the other.&quot;</span>

    <span class="s2">&quot;Me&quot;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Are you going home now? Wanna walk back with me?&quot;</span>

    <span class="s2">&quot;Sylvie&quot;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Sure!&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This is a very simple Ren'Py game. It doesn't include any pictures or
music, but it does show a conversation between two characters, and a
line of narration.</p>
<p>To try this out, from the top screen of the launcher select &quot;My Question&quot;
project, and then choose &quot;script.rpy&quot; from under Edit File. If this is
your first time, Ren'Py will ask you to select an editor (we recommend
Editra for first time creators), and will download the editor you choose.
Then it will open the script file in the editor.</p>
<p>Once the editor opens, erase everything in script.rpy. We're starting
from scratch, so you don't need what's there. Copy the example above into
script.ry, and save it.</p>
<p>You're now ready to run this example. Go back to the launcher, and
choose &quot;Launch Project&quot;. Ren'Py will start up. Notice how, without any
extra work, Ren'Py has given you menus that let you load and save the
game, and change various preferences. When ready, click &quot;Launch Project&quot;,
and play through this example game.</p>
<p>This example shows some of the commonly-used Ren'Py statements.</p>
<p>The first line is a label statement. The label statement is used to
give a name to a place in the program. In this case, we create a label
named <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">start</span></code>. The start label is special, as it's where Ren'Py
scripts begin running when the user clicks &quot;Start Game&quot; on the main
menu.</p>
<p>The other lines are say statements. There are two forms of the say
statement. The first is a string (beginning with a double-quote,
containing characters, and ending with a double-quote) on a line by
itself, which is used for narration, and the thoughts of the main
character. The second form consists of two strings. It's used for
dialogue, with the first string being a character name and the second
being what that character is saying.</p>
<p>Note that all the say statements are indented by four spaces. This is
because they are a block underneath the label statement. In Ren'Py,
blocks must be indented relative to the prior statement, and all of
the statements in a block must be indented by the same amount.</p>
<p>When strings contain double-quote characters, those characters need to
be preceded by a backslash. For example</p>
<div class="highlight-renpy"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>
    <span class="s2">&quot;Sylvie&quot;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Did you ever hear Lincon&#39;s famous saying, </span><span class="se">\&quot;</span><span class="s2">The problem with Internet quotations is that many of them are not genuine.</span><span class="se">\&quot;</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>While this simple game isn't much to look at, it's an example of how
easy it is to get something working in Ren'Py. We'll add the pictures
in a little bit, but first, let's see how to define characters.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="characters">
<h2>Characters<a class="headerlink" href="#characters" title="Permalink to this headline"> link</a></h2>
<p>One problem with the first example is that it requires you to
repeatedly type the name of a character each time they speak. In a
dialogue-heavy game, this might be a lot of typing. Also, both
character names are displayed in the same way, in the accent color
selected when starting the game. To fix this, Ren'Py lets you define
characters in advance. This lets you associate a short name with a
character, and to change the color of the character's name.</p>
<div class="highlight-renpy"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">define</span> <span class="n">s</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Character</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;Sylvie&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="na">color</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;#c8ffc8&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">define</span> <span class="n">m</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Character</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;Me&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="na">color</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;#c8c8ff&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">label</span> <span class="n">start</span><span class="p">:</span>

    <span class="n">s</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Hi there! How was class?&quot;</span>

    <span class="n">m</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Good...&quot;</span>

    <span class="s2">&quot;I can&#39;t bring myself to admit that it all went in one ear and out the other.&quot;</span>

    <span class="n">s</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Are you going home now? Wanna walk back with me?&quot;</span>

    <span class="n">m</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Sure!&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The first and and second lines define characters. The first line
defines a character with the short name of &quot;s&quot;, the long name
&quot;Sylvie&quot;, with a name that is shown in a greenish color. (The colors
are red-green-blue hex triples, as used in web pages.)</p>
<p>The second line creates a character with a short name &quot;m&quot;, a long name
&quot;Me&quot;, with the name shown in a reddish color. Other characters can be
defined by copying one of the character lines, and changing the short
name, long name, and color.</p>
<p>We've also changed the say statements to use character objects instead
of a character name string. This tells Ren'Py to use the characters
we defined.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="images">
<h2>Images<a class="headerlink" href="#images" title="Permalink to this headline"> link</a></h2>
<p>A visual novel isn't much of a visual novel without pictures. Here's another
scene from &quot;The Question&quot;. This also includes statements that show images

you want to try it out.</p>

    <span class="s2">&quot;Silence.&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This segment of script introduces two new statements. The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">scene</span></code> statement on
line 6 clears all images and displays a background image. The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">show</span></code> statements
on lines 16 and 26 display a sprite on top of the background, and change the
displaying sprite, respectively.</p>
<p>In Ren'Py, each image has a name. The name consists of a tag, and optionally
one or more attributes. Both the tag and attributes should begin with a
letter, and contain letters, numbers, and underscores. For example:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>In the scene statement on line 6, the tag is &quot;bg&quot;, and the attribute is
&quot;meadow.&quot;  By convention, background images should use the tag bg.</li>
<li>In the first show statement on line 16, the tag is &quot;sylvie&quot;, and the
attributes are &quot;green&quot; and &quot;smile&quot;.</li>
<li>In the second show statement on line 26, the tage is &quot;sylvie&quot;, and the
attributes are &quot;green&quot; and &quot;surprised&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>Only one image with a given tag can be shown at the same time. When a
second image with the same tag is show, it replaces the first image, as
happens on line 26.</p>
<p>Ren'Py searches for image files in the images directory, which can be
found by selecting &quot;images&quot; in the &quot;Open Directory&quot; section of the
launcher. Ren'Py expects character art to be an PNG or WEBP file,
while background art should be a JPG, JPEG, PNG, or WEBP file.
The name of a file is very important – the extension is removed, the file
name is forced to lowercase, and that's used as the image name.</p>
<p>For example, the following files, placed in the images directory, define the
following images.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>&quot;bg meadow.jpg&quot; -&gt; <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">bg</span> <span class="pre">meadow</span></code></li>
<li>&quot;sylvie green smile.png&quot; -&gt; <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sylvie</span> <span class="pre">green</span> <span class="pre">smile</span></code></li>
<li>&quot;sylvie green surprised.png&quot; -&gt; <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sylvie</span> <span class="pre">green</span> <span class="pre">surprised</span></code></li>
</ul>
<p>Since the filenames are lowercase, the following also holds.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>&quot;Sylvie Green Surprised.png&quot; -&gt; <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sylvie</span> <span class="pre">green</span> <span class="pre">surprised</span></code></li>
</ul>
<p>Images can be placed in subdirectories (subfolders) under the images directory.
The directory name is ignored and only the filename is used to define the
image name.</p>
<p><strong>Hide Statement.</strong>
Ren'Py also supports a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">hide</span></code> statement, which hides the given image.</p>
<div class="highlight-renpy"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">label</span> <span class="n">leaving</span><span class="p">:</span>

    <span class="n">s</span> <span class="s2">&quot;I&#39;ll get right on it!&quot;</span>

    <span class="k">hide</span> <span class="n">sylvie</span>

    <span class="s2">&quot;...&quot;</span>

    <span class="n">m</span> <span class="s2">&quot;That wasn&#39;t what I meant!&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>It's actually pretty rare that you'll need to use hide. Show can be
used when a character is changing emotions, while scene is used when
everyone leaves. You only need to use hide when a character leaves and
the scene stays the same.</p>
<p><strong>Image Statement.</strong>
Sometimes, a creator might not want to let Ren'Py define images
automatically. This is what the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">image</span></code> statement is for. It should
be at the top level of the file (unindented, and before label start),
and can be used to map an image name to an image file. For example:</p>
<div class="highlight-renpy"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">image</span> <span class="n">logo</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;renpy logo.png&quot;</span>
<span class="k">image</span> <span class="n">eileen</span> <span class="n">happy</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;eileen_happy_blue_dress.png&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The image statement is run at init time, before label start and the rest
of the game script that interacts with the player.</p>
<p>The image statement can also be used for more complex tasks, but that's
discussed <a class="reference internal" href="displaying_images.html#displaying-images"><span class="std std-ref">elsewhere</span></a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="transitions">
<h2>Transitions<a class="headerlink" href="#transitions" title="Permalink to this headline"> link</a></h2>
<p>In the script above, pictures pop in and out instantaneously. Since
changing location or having a character enter or leave a scene is
important, Ren'Py supports transitions that allow effects to be
applied when what is being shown changes.</p>
<p>Transitions change what is displayed from what it was at the end of
the last interaction (dialogue, menu, or transition – among other
statements) to what it looks like after scene, show, and hide statements
have run.</p>
<div class="highlight-renpy"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">label</span> <span class="n">start</span><span class="p">:</span>

    <span class="k">scene</span> <span class="n">bg</span> <span class="n">meadow</span>
    <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">fade</span>

    <span class="s2">&quot;After a short while, we reach the meadows just outside the neighborhood where we both live.&quot;</span>

    <span class="s2">&quot;It&#39;s a scenic view I&#39;ve grown used to. Autumn is especially beautiful here.&quot;</span>

    <span class="s2">&quot;When we were children, we played in these meadows a lot, so they&#39;re full of memories.&quot;</span>

    <span class="n">m</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Hey... Umm...&quot;</span>

    <span class="k">show</span> <span class="n">sylvie</span> <span class="n">green</span> <span class="n">smile</span>
    <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">dissolve</span>

    <span class="s2">&quot;She turns to me and smiles. She looks so welcoming that I feel my nervousness melt away.&quot;</span>

    <span class="s2">&quot;I&#39;ll ask her...!&quot;</span>

    <span class="n">m</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Ummm... Will you...&quot;</span>

    <span class="n">m</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Will you be my artist for a visual novel?&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The with statement takes the name of a transition to use. The most
common one is <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dissolve</span></code> which dissolves from one screen to the
next. Another useful transition is <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fade</span></code> which fades the
screen to black, and then fades in the new screen.</p>
<p>When a transition is placed after multiple scene, show, or hide
statements, it applies to them all at once. If you were to write:</p>
<div class="highlight-renpy"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>
    <span class="k">scene</span> <span class="n">bg</span> <span class="n">meadow</span>
    <span class="k">show</span> <span class="n">sylvie</span> <span class="n">green</span> <span class="n">smile</span>
    <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">dissolve</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Both the &quot;bg meadow&quot; and &quot;sylvie green smile&quot; images would be dissolved in
at the same time. To dissolve them in one at a time, you need to write two
with statements:</p>
<div class="highlight-renpy"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>
    <span class="k">scene</span> <span class="n">bg</span> <span class="n">meadow</span>
    <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">dissolve</span>
    <span class="k">show</span> <span class="n">sylvie</span> <span class="n">green</span> <span class="n">smile</span>
    <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">dissolve</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This first dissolves in the meadow, and then dissolves in sylvie. If
you wanted to instantly show the meadow, and then show sylvie, you
could write:</p>
<div class="highlight-renpy"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>
    <span class="k">scene</span> <span class="n">bg</span> <span class="n">meadow</span>
    <span class="k">with</span> <span class="bp">None</span>
    <span class="k">show</span> <span class="n">sylvie</span> <span class="n">smile</span>
    <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">dissolve</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Here, None is used to indicate a special transition that updates
Ren'Py's idea of what the prior screen was, without actually showing
anything to the player.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="positions">
<h2>Positions<a class="headerlink" href="#positions" title="Permalink to this headline"> link</a></h2>
<p>By default, images are shown centered horizontally, and with their
bottom edge touching the bottom of the screen. This is usually okay
for backgrounds and single characters, but when showing more than one
character on the screen it probably makes sense to do it at another
position. It also might make sense to reposition a character for story
purposes.</p>
<div class="highlight-renpy"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>
     <span class="k">show</span> <span class="n">sylvie</span> <span class="n">green</span> <span class="n">smile</span> <span class="k">at</span> <span class="n">right</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To do this repositioning, add an <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">at</span></code> clause to a show statement. The at
clause takes a position, and shows the image at that position. Ren'Py
includes several predefined positions: <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">left</span></code> for the left side of
the screen, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">right</span></code> for the right side, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">center</span></code> for centered
horizontally (the default), and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">truecenter</span></code> for centered
horizontally and vertically.</p>
<p>Creators can define their own positions, and event complicated moves,
but that's outside of the scope of this quickstart.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="music-and-sound">
<h2>Music and Sound<a class="headerlink" href="#music-and-sound" title="Permalink to this headline"> link</a></h2>
<p>Most Ren'Py games play music in the background. Music is played with the
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">play</span> <span class="pre">music</span></code> statement. The play music statement takes a filename that
is interpreted as an audio file to play.  Audio filenames are interpreted
relative to the game directory. Audio files should be in opus, ogg vorbis,
or mp3 format.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<div class="highlight-renpy"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>
    <span class="k">play</span> <span class="k">music</span> <span class="s2">&quot;illurock.ogg&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>When changing music, one can supply a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fadeout</span></code> and a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fadein</span></code> clause, which
are used to fade out the old music and fade in the new music.</p>
<div class="highlight-renpy"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>
    <span class="k">play</span> <span class="k">music</span> <span class="s2">&quot;illurock.ogg&quot;</span> <span class="n">fadeout</span> <span class="mf">1.0</span> <span class="n">fadein</span> <span class="mf">1.0</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">queue</span> <span class="pre">music</span></code> statement plays an audio file after the current file
finishes playing.</p>
<div class="highlight-renpy"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>
    <span class="k">queue</span> <span class="k">music</span> <span class="s2">&quot;next_track.opus&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Music can be stopped with the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stop</span> <span class="pre">music</span></code> statement, which can also
optionally take a fadeout clause.</p>
<div class="highlight-renpy"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>
    <span class="k">stop</span> <span class="k">music</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Sound effects can be played with the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">play</span> <span class="pre">sound</span></code> statement. Unlike music, sound
effects do not loop.</p>
<div class="highlight-renpy"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>
    <span class="k">play</span> <span class="k">sound</span> <span class="s2">&quot;effect.ogg&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pause-statement">
<h2>Pause Statement<a class="headerlink" href="#pause-statement" title="Permalink to this headline"> link</a></h2>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pause</span></code> statement causes Ren'Py to pause until the mouse is clicked.</p>
<div class="highlight-renpy"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>
    <span class="k">pause</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If a number is given, the pause will end when that number of seconds

<div class="section" id="ending-the-game">
<h2>Ending the Game<a class="headerlink" href="#ending-the-game" title="Permalink to this headline"> link</a></h2>
<p>You can end the game by running the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">return</span></code> statement, without having
called anything. Before doing this, it's best to put something in the
game that indicates that the game is ending, and perhaps giving the
user an ending number or ending name.</p>
<div class="highlight-renpy"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>

<p>That's all you need to make a kinetic novel, a game without any
choices in it. Now, we'll look at what it takes to make a game that
presents menus to the user.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="menus-labels-and-jumps">
<h2>Menus, Labels, and Jumps<a class="headerlink" href="#menus-labels-and-jumps" title="Permalink to this headline"> link</a></h2>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">menu</span></code> statement lets presents a choice to the player:</p>
<div class="highlight-renpy"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>
    <span class="n">s</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Sure, but what&#39;s a </span><span class="se">\&quot;</span><span class="s2">visual novel?</span><span class="se">\&quot;</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>

<span class="k">menu</span><span class="p">:</span>

    <span class="s2">&quot;It&#39;s a videogame.&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">jump</span> <span class="n">game</span>

    <span class="s2">&quot;It&#39;s an interactive book.&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">jump</span> <span class="n">book</span>

<span class="k">label</span> <span class="n">game</span><span class="p">:</span>

    <span class="n">m</span> <span class="s2">&quot;It&#39;s a kind of videogame you can play on your computer or a console.&quot;</span>

    <span class="k">jump</span> <span class="n">marry</span>

<span class="k">label</span> <span class="n">book</span><span class="p">:</span>

    <span class="n">m</span> <span class="s2">&quot;It&#39;s like an interactive book that you can read on a computer or a console.&quot;</span>

    <span class="k">jump</span> <span class="n">marry</span>

<span class="k">label</span> <span class="n">marry</span><span class="p">:</span>

    <span class="s2">&quot;And so, we become a visual novel creating duo.&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This example shows how a menu can be used with Ren'Py. The menu statement
introduces an in-game choice. It takes an indented block of lines, each
consisting of a string followed by a colon. These are the menu choices that are
presented to the player. Each menu choice takes its own indented block of lines,
which is run when that menu choices is chosen.</p>
<p>In this example, each of the two menu choices runs a single <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">jump</span></code> statement.
The jump statement transfers control to the a label defined using the label
statement. After a jump, script statements following the label are run.</p>
<p>In the example above, after Sylvie asks her question, the player is presented
with a menu containing two choices. If the player picked &quot;It's a videogame.&quot;,
the first jump statement is run, and Ren'Py will jump to the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">game</span></code> label.
This will cause the POV character to say &quot;It's a story with pictures and music.&quot;,
after which Ren'Py will jump to the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">marry</span></code> label.</p>
<p>If there is no jump statement at the end of the block associated with the label,
Ren'Py will continue on to the next statement. The last jump statement here is
technically unnecessary, but is included since it makes the flow of the game
clearer.</p>
<p>Labels may be defined in any file that is in the game directory, and ends with
.rpy. The filename doesn't matter to Ren'Py, only the labels contained inside
it. You can think of all the .rpy files as being equivalent to a single big
.rpy file, with jumps used to transfer control. This gives you flexibility
in how you organize the script of a larger game.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="supporting-flags-using-the-default-python-and-if-statements">
<h2>Supporting Flags using the Default, Python and If Statements<a class="headerlink" href="#supporting-flags-using-the-default-python-and-if-statements" title="Permalink to this headline"> link</a></h2>
<p>While some games can be made by only using the statements given above,
other games requires data to be stored and recalled later. For example,
it might make sense for a game to remember a choice a player has made,
return to a common section of the script, and act on the choice later. This
is one of the reasons why Ren'Py has embedded Python support.</p>
<p>Here, we'll show how to store a flag containing information about a choice
the player has made. To initialize the flag, use the default statement, before
label start.</p>
<div class="highlight-renpy"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># True if the player has decided to compare a VN to a book.</span>
<span class="k">default</span> <span class="n">book</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">False</span>

<span class="k">label</span> <span class="n">start</span><span class="p">:</span>

    <span class="n">s</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Hi there! How was class?&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The book flag starts off initialized to the special value <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">False</span></code>
(as with the rest of Ren'Py, capitalization matters), meaning that
it is not set. If the book path is chosen, we can set it to True
using a Python assignment statement.</p>
<div class="highlight-renpy"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">label</span> <span class="n">book</span><span class="p">:</span>

    <span class="k">$</span> <span class="n">book</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">True</span>

    <span class="n">m</span> <span class="s2">&quot;It&#39;s like an interactive book that you can read on a computer or a console.&quot;</span>

    <span class="k">jump</span> <span class="n">marry</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Lines beginning with a dollar-sign are interpreted as Python statements. The
assignment statement here assigns a value to a variable. Ren'Py has support
for other ways of including Python, such as a multi-line Python statement,
that are discussed in other sections of this manual. Ren'Py supports Python 2.7,
though we strongly recommend you write Python that runs in Python 2 and Python 3.</p>
<p>To check the flag, use the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">if</span></code> statement:</p>
<div class="highlight-renpy"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">book</span><span class="p">:</span>

    <span class="s2">&quot;Our first game is based on one of Sylvie&#39;s ideas, but afterwards I get to come up with stories of my own, too.&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If the condition is true, the block of script is run. If not, it is skipped.
The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">if</span></code> statement can also take an <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">else</span></code> clause, that introduced a block of
script that is run if the condition is false.</p>
<div class="highlight-renpy"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">book</span><span class="p">:</span>

    <span class="s2">&quot;Our first game is based on one of Sylvie&#39;s ideas, but afterwards I get to come up with stories of my own, too.&quot;</span>

<span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>

    <span class="s2">&quot;Sylvie helped with the script on our first video game.&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Python variables need not be simple True/False values. Variables can be
used to store the player's name, a points score, or for any other
purpose. Since Ren'Py includes the ability to use the full Python
programming language, many things are possible.</p>

<div class="section" id="releasing-your-game">
<h2>Releasing Your Game<a class="headerlink" href="#releasing-your-game" title="Permalink to this headline"> link</a></h2>

before releasing it:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><strong>Check for a new version of Ren'Py.</strong></dt>
<dd><p class="first">New versions of Ren'Py are released on a regular basis to fix bugs

<dd>Lint is not a substitute for thorough testing. It's your
responsibility to check your game before it is released. Consider asking
friends to help beta-test your game, as often a tester can find problems
you can't.</dd>
<dt><strong>Release.</strong></dt>
<dd><p class="first">Once the game has been finished and tested, you should post the generated
archive files on the web somewhere people can see them. (If you don't
have your own website, <a class="reference external" href="https://itch.io">https://itch.io</a> hosts a lot
of visual novels.) Congratulations, you've released your first visual novel!</p>
<p>There are a few places where a game can be announced:</p>
<ul class="last simple">
<li>The <a class="reference external" href="https://games.renpy.org">Ren'Py Games List</a> helps us keep track of
Ren'Py games being made.</li>
<li>The <a class="reference external" href="https://lemmasoft.renai.us/forums/viewforum.php?f=11">Completed Games section of the Lemma Soft Forums</a> is a
good place to tell fellow creators about your game.</li>
</ul>

<p>This Quickstart barely scratches the surface of what Ren'Py is capable of.
For brevity's sake, we've omitted many features Ren'Py supports and
simplified others – focusing on the minimum set of features used to make a
visual novel.</p>
<p>To get a feel for what Ren'Py is capable of, please play through the Tutorial,
and perhaps some of the games featured on the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.renpy.org">Ren'Py website</a>.
You may also want to read the rest of this manual, starting with the <a class="reference internal" href="gui.html#gui"><span class="std std-ref">GUI Customization
Guide</span></a>.</p>
<p>Beyond that, we recommend checking out the Ren'Py section of the <a class="reference external" href="https://lemmasoft.renai.us/forums">Lemma Soft Forums</a>, which
has a section for asking questions, and a cookbook section with libraries and examples meant for reuse. The Lemma Soft Forums are the
central hub of the Ren'Py community, where we welcome new creators and the questions they bring.</p>
<p>Thank you for choosing the Ren'Py visual novel engine. We look forward to seeing
what you create with it!</p>
